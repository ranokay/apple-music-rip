# Apple Music Downloader Web UI

A simple, user-friendly web interface which works sometime for the Apple Music Downloader, allowing you to easily download high-quality audio from Apple Music.

## 🎵 About

This project serves as a graphical frontend for the powerful command-line tools developed by the community. It provides a clean, browser-based UI to search, configure, and download tracks without needing to interact with the terminal directly.

**Powered by:**

- **[zhaarey/apple-music-downloader](https://github.com/zhaarey/apple-music-downloader)** - The core Go-based downloader.
- **[WorldObservationLog/wrapper](https://github.com/WorldObservationLog/wrapper)** - The Android emulation wrapper for authentication (forked/based on **[zhaarey/wrapper](https://github.com/zhaarey/wrapper)**).

## ✨ Features

- **🌐 Web Interface**: Modern, responsive UI accessible from any browser.
- **🔐 Auto-Login**: Securely handles credentials and session management.
- **🎵 Multiple Formats**: Support for **ALAC** (Lossless), **AAC**, and **Dolby Atmos** (Spatial Audio).
- **📊 Real-time Monitoring**: Live logs for download progress and wrapper status.
- **⚙️ Complete Control**: Configure all downloader settings (quality, file naming, lyrics, etc.) via the UI.
- **🛠️ Self-Bootstrapping**: Automated setup script handles dependencies and compilation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Linux** (x86_64 or aarch64) - Designed for Linux environments (including WSL).
- **Root/Sudo Access** - Required for the initial setup script to install dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HARAJIT05/apple-music-rip.git
    cd alac-rip
    ```

2. **Run the setup script:**

    ```bash
    sudo python3 main.py
    ```

    This script will automatically:
    - Install the **Nix** package manager (if missing) to create a reproducible environment.
    - Download the **Android NDK** and compile the necessary **Wrapper** tool.
    - Clone the **Apple Music Downloader** repository.
    - Start the Web UI.

3. **Access the UI:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

## 📖 Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Login**: On the dashboard, click **"Login to Wrapper"**.
2. **Status**: Monitor the logs for a successful login message (e.g., `[.] response type 6` or similar success indicators).

### Getting Your Media User Token

If the automatic login doesn't work or if you need to manually configure the token in **Settings**:

1. Open [music.apple.com](https://music.apple.com) in your web browser and log in.
2. Open **Developer Tools** (Press `F12` or right-click > Inspect).
3. Navigate to the **Application** tab (or **Storage** tab in Firefox).
4. Expand **Cookies** and select `https://music.apple.com`.
5. Find the cookie named `media-user-token`.
6. Copy its **Value** (it looks like a long string starting with `At...`).
7. Paste this value into the **Media User Token** field in the Web UI **Settings**.

### Downloading Music

1. **Select Format**: Choose between **AAC**, **ALAC** (Lossless), or **Atmos** (Spatial Audio).
    - *Note: For Atmos or ALAC, ensure "Special Audio" or relevant quality settings are enabled.*
2. **Paste URL**: Enter an Apple Music album, playlist, or song URL.
3. **Download**: Hit the download button and watch the progress in the logs.

## 📝 Changelog

### Recent Updates

- **UI Overhaul**: The "Special Audio" checkbox and separate format selectors have been unified into a single **Audio Quality** group for better clarity.
- **Hi-Res Support**: Added a dedicated **Hi-Res Lossless** option. This automatically configures the downloader to fetch higher quality manifests when available.
- **Smart Configuration**: The backend now dynamically updates the `get-m3u8-mode` setting based on your selection (switching between `web` for standard/AAC/Atmos and `hires` for Hi-Res), streamlining the download process.
- **Atmos Warnings**: Added UI alerts for Dolby Atmos mode to inform users about potential availability issues.
